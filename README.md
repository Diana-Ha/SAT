# SAT
Goal: How to improve SAT exam participation rates
Data Provided: SAT (filename: "sat.csv") and ACT (filename: "act.csv") scores and participation rates by state for the graduating class of 2017

### Data Sources
SAT: https://blog.prepscholar.com/average-sat-scores-by-state-most-recent   
ACT: https://blog.prepscholar.com/act-scores-by-state-averages-highs-and-lows

### To Start:
Go to the folder named "code" and open the notebook called "starter-code.ipynb". As you go through the notebook, you will notice that I comment on the purpose of every cell and, when applicable, I also comment on the output. 

In terms of the work flow, I describe the data and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) via visualizations and NumPy. All analysis and recommendations are documented in the presentation (filename: "SAT.pdf").

### Final Recommendations:
Open the file named "SAT.pdf" to see my final recommendations and next steps.
